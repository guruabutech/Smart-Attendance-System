# Smart-Attendance-System

The register based conventional attendance system for students in institutions is time consuming and a laborious
task for teachers so we have developed and deployed an intelligent system based on fingerprint scanner to replace the
traditional attendance system which can acquire, and store and check the fingerprints of students and export the data in the
form of their attendance record to a centralized database which is used by an Android Application developed which helps the
administration and the students to view their attendance in real time and the entire system is cheap and reliable.
